# CNN Gait Library for Gait-based Biometrics

Francisco M. Castro and Manuel J. Marin-Jimenez

This library contains support Matlab code for [1].

### Prerequisites
1. MatConvNet library: http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/
1. Tukey loss function (for regression): http://campar.in.tum.de/twiki/pub/Chair/DeepReg/deepreg.html

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and Matlab 2013b.

### Quick start
Let's assume that you have placed _CNNGait_ library in folder `<cgdir>`. 
Start Matlab and type the following commands:

```
cd <cgdir>
startup_cnngait
cg_demo_test
```
